      <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction to Python</h2>
      <p>
        Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language. It is widely
        used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and
        more. Let's start with some basic concepts.
      </p>
      <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Try modifying the above code to print your own name. For example,
        <code>print("Hello, Alice!")</code>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="variables">2. Variables and Data Types</h2>
      <p>
        Variables are used to store data. Python has several data types,
        including integers, floats, strings, and lists.
      </p>
      <pre><code># Integer
age = 25

# Float
price = 19.99

# String
name = "Alice"

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Declare a variable for your favorite color and print it. For example,
        <code>color = "blue"</code> then <code>print(color)</code>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="functions">3. Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help
        organize and reuse code.
      </p>
      <pre><code>def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Create a function that adds two numbers and prints the result. For
        example, <code>def add(a, b): print(a + b)</code> then
        <code>add(2, 3)</code>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conditionals">4. Conditionals and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Conditionals (if statements) allow you to execute code based on
        conditions. Loops (for and while) let you repeat code multiple times.
      </p>
      <h3>Conditionals Example</h3>
      <pre><code>age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Write a conditional that checks if a number is positive, negative, or
        zero and prints a message accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>Loops Example</h3>
      <pre><code># For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Write a for loop that prints all the numbers from 1 to 10. Then, write a
        while loop that does the same.
      </p>

      <h2 id="classes">5. Classes and Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Classes are blueprints for creating objects. An object is an instance of
        a class. Classes encapsulate data and functions that operate on the
        data.
      </p>
      <pre><code>class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
my_dog.bark()
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Create a class for a Cat with a name and an age. Add a method to make
        the cat meow. Create an instance of the Cat class and call the meow
        method.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rpg">6. Building the RPG Step-by-Step</h2>
      <p>Now that you know the basics, let's build the RPG step-by-step.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Define the Player and Enemy Classes</h3>
      <pre><code>class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hp = 100
        self.attack = 10
        self.defense = 5
        self.alive = True

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.hp -= damage
        if self.hp <= 0:
            self.hp = 0
            self.alive = False

    def attack_enemy(self, enemy):
        damage = self.attack - enemy.defense
        if damage > 0:
            enemy.take_damage(damage)
            print(f"{self.name} attacks {enemy.name} for {damage} damage.")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name}'s attack was too weak to harm {enemy.name}.")

class Enemy:
    def __init__(self, name, hp, attack, defense):
        self.name = name
        self.hp = hp
        self.attack = attack
        self.defense = defense
        self.alive = True

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.hp -= damage
        if self.hp <= 0:
            self.hp = 0
            self.alive = False

    def attack_player(self, player):
        damage = self.attack - player.defense
        if damage > 0:
            player.take_damage(damage)
            print(f"{self.name} attacks {player.name} for {damage} damage.")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name}'s attack was too weak to harm {player.name}.")
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Create another class for a different type of enemy (e.g., Dragon) with
        higher health and attack values.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Create Combat Function</h3>
      <pre><code>def print_status(player, enemy):
    print(f"{player.name}: HP={player.hp}")
    print(f"{enemy.name}: HP={enemy.hp}")

def combat(player, enemy):
    print(f"A wild {enemy.name} appears!")
    while player.alive and enemy.alive:
        print_status(player, enemy)
        action = input("Do you want to (1) attack or (2) defend? ")
        if action == "1":
            player.attack_enemy(enemy)
        else:
            print(f"{player.name} is defending.")
            player.defense += 5  # Temporary defense boost for defending

        if enemy.alive:
            enemy.attack_player(player)
        if action == "2":
            player.defense -= 5  # Remove the temporary defense boost

    if player.alive:
        print(f"{player.name} has defeated {enemy.name}!")
    else:
        print(f"{player.name} has been defeated by {enemy.name}.")
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Add another combat option (e.g., use a potion to heal) and update the
        combat function accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3: Create the Adventure Function</h3>
      <pre><code>def start_adventure():
    print("Welcome to the adventure game!")
    player_name = input("Enter your character's name: ")
    player = Player(player_name)

    print(f"{player.name}, you find yourself in a dark forest.")
    print("A path splits into two directions.")
    choice = input("Do you want to go (1) left or (2) right? ")

    if choice == "1":
        print(f"{player.name} takes the left path and encounters a goblin!")
        goblin = Enemy("Goblin", 30, 5, 2)
        combat(player, goblin)
    else:
        print(f"{player.name} takes the right path and encounters a wolf!")
        wolf = Enemy("Wolf", 50, 7, 3)
        combat(player, wolf)

    if player.alive:
        print(f"{player.name} continues deeper into the forest and finds a treasure chest.")
        print("Congratulations, you've completed the adventure!")
    else:
        print("Game Over. Better luck next time!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_adventure()
</code></pre>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Add another choice for the player and create a new enemy encounter or
        event based on that choice.
      </p>

      <h2 id="improve">7. Adding Features and Improving the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have the basic structure of the game, here are some ideas
        for improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Add More Enemies and Choices</strong>: Create different
          enemies with varying strengths and weaknesses. Add more story paths
          and choices for the player.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Implement Inventory System</strong>: Allow the player to
          collect and use items.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhance Combat System</strong>: Add more combat actions like
          special attacks or spells. Introduce enemy behaviors and AI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Save and Load Game</strong>: Implement a save and load feature
          to store and retrieve game states.
        </li>
      </ul>
